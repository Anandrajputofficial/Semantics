(1) What are the new things introduced in HTML5?

HTML5 introduced several new features, including:

New semantic elements, such as <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <section>, which provide more meaning to the structure of web page content.

The <canvas> element, which allows for the creation of dynamic graphics and animations.

The <video> and <audio> elements, which provide native support for multimedia content without the need for additional plug-ins.

Web storage, which allows for more efficient data storage on the client side, and offline web application capabilities.

Web sockets, which enable real-time communication between the browser and the server.

Improved form controls, such as new input types (e.g., email, search) and new attributes (e.g., required, placeholder).

Microdata, which allows for the embedding of structured data in HTML pages.

Drag-and-drop capabilities, which allow users to drag and drop files, images, and other elements between different parts of the web page or between different web pages.

(2) What are the semantic tag? give a couple of examples .

Semantic tags are HTML tags that provide meaning to the structure of the content on a web page. They describe the type of content contained within them, rather than its presentation. A couple of examples of semantic tags in HTML5 are:

<header> - This tag is used to define the header section of a web page, which typically contains the site title or logo, and the main navigation menu.

<nav> - This tag is used to define a section of the web page that contains navigation links.

<main> - This tag is used to define the main content of the web page, which is unique to the document, excluding content that is repeated across a set of documents such as site headers, footers, and navigation.

<article> - This tag is used to define a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or news story, that can be independently syndicated.

<section> - This tag is used to group content together that has a similar theme or purpose, such as a group of related articles or a set of related form controls.

<aside> - This tag is used to define content that is related to the main content, but is considered separate, such as sidebar information or pull quotes.

<footer> - This tag is used to define the footer section of a web page, which typically contains copyright information and links to related pages.

(3) List some uses of semantic tag? 

Some uses of semantic tags in HTML5 include:

Improving accessibility: Semantic tags make it easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to understand the structure and content of a web page.

Enhancing search engine optimization (SEO): Search engines use the information provided by semantic tags to understand the content of a web page and rank it accordingly.

Simplifying CSS styling: Semantic tags make it easier to target specific sections of a web page with CSS, making it more efficient to style and layout the page.

Improving code readability: Semantic tags make it easier to understand the structure and organization of a web page when reading the HTML code.

Making it easier to create responsive designs: Semantic tags can be used to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

Creating reusable components: Semantic tags can be used to create reusable components that can be easily used across multiple pages, which makes development and maintenance more efficient.

Facilitating dynamic updates: Semantic tags can be used to create dynamic web pages that can update without requiring a full page refresh.

Creating a more organized and consistent codebase: Using semantic tags makes it easier to maintain consistency and organization throughout a codebase, making it more manageable to work with.
